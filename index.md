title: "About Bryan"

Since you are here I am assuming you want to get to know a little about me! Well, I'm a tech enthusiast who wants to get away from all the tech, a scifi film buff who saw Kickass before 2001 A Space Odyssey, and an avid gamer who plays modded Minecraft. Oh...did I tell you my name yet? I'm Bryan Lee by the way and I hope you stick around and check out my blog!
